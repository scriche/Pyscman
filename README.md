# Pyscman
*Python Script Manager*
---
A Simple Web interface for scheduling, editing and running python scripts in Docker

Web interface is at (http://localhost:8080)

This is my personal project i made to run simple python scripts for automation, information gathering, notifications, etc... 

**Warning this is not secure in the slightest. It may be a Docker container but every script has access to the other scripts and can run anything from PIP aswell**

The web interface should have everything you would need to watch and manage the scripts if not make a issue or pull request to add a feature
